# Anton Roy

Welcome to my protfolio

My name is Anton Roy. I'm a gameplay programmer with interest in game design and graphic programation. This site is for sowcasing some of the projects I've worked on
for more infos on my parcour, please see my Resume Or my LinkedIn Profile

## Sumrfs Epic Run
(2016 - IOS & Android)
This is the first game I've worked on while working at Ubisoft Paris Mobile. I've done a lot of programing on this game, ranging from core gameplay feature to tool programming for the game designers (and some graphic effects)

## Air Dasher
(2017 - IOS & Android)
I made this game on my own as an independent. Using Unity I've produce this platformer featuring 66 handcrafted levels. The goal was to make a mobile platformer that felt good and smooth without relying on buttons for the core gameplay.

## Shadertoys & Shadershowdowns
I am a big fan of shader based demo. I regularly post on the site shadertoy.com. Shadertoy are graphical effect or drawing made entirly on the GPU. From the CPU side, only two triangles are rendered. The disipline require many mathematical and coding tricks to define complexe and eye pleasing images only in the Pixel Shader. I also sometime take part in events called Shader Showdown. In thoses, participant are tasked to come up with the best looking effects while live coding in just under 25 minutes.

## Tile Link
(Unreleased IOS & Android)
This is the second game I intend to relaese as an independent. Tile link is a zen puzzle game drawing its inspiration from games such as Three and 2048. For this production I focus mainly on polish and visual pleasing feedbacks. Since I'm deep into developpment right now, I don't know when this game will be finished.

## The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot Mobile
(unreleased)
This Is the second game I'm working on at Ubisoft right now. Since it is unreleased at Time of writting, I can not share much detail about the game. Still, this is a Unity game aiming the AAA segment of mobile games. I've work on gameplay features, toolmaking and serverside implementation.

## Other projects
I am a productive programmer and I often start new projects even if they don't go very far. 
At the moment I am working on an Arduino/Unity project that I call "Shitty Keyboard"
For the sake of the challenge I've made a small game called compressed. the full code fit into 200 lines of lua code (using the LÃ¶ve2D Framework) including basic online leaderboard
I'm interested in boardgames and I've tried several times to design my own.
As a graduate, I highly value the experiences I've had and I want to share my knowledge. As such, I'm regularely interacting with the Paris5 University to show the basics of game programing to students.
